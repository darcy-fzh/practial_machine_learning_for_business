I am working in AI solution provider and all the solutions are practical, scalable, transformative, there is no science projects.

To construct a successful solution, most of the effort are not focused on the algorithm. Choose a advanced algorithm is not the only important thing.

What really matter is the data. We are able to collect the data from all disperse system, but they come to us in totally chaotic form. Therefore, we have to do preparation before we put it in machine learning.
